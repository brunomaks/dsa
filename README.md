# Introduction

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in C. Each implementation is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to understand. The code is well-documented, and the algorithmic complexity of each method is explained in detail to help you learn how these data structures perform in different scenarios. Repository provides a resource for understanding how data structures work under the hood.

## Data Structures Implemented

### Linked List

A **singly linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains data and a pointer to the next node.

---

### Dynamic Array

A **dynamic array** is a resizable array that automatically grows as elements are added.
